# Introduction
This TicTacToe game is a simple yet classic implementation of the well-known game using C# programming language and the Unity game development engine. The objective of the game is to form a line of three of your symbols (either "X" or "O") on a 3x3 grid.

# Features
* Player vs. Player: Play against a friend on the same device, taking turns to make your moves.
* Winning Logic: The game automatically detects when a player wins or if the game ends in a draw.
* UI Feedback: Clear UI messages provide feedback on game status, such as whose turn it is or when the game is over.
* Restart: After a game concludes, players can easily restart and play again.
